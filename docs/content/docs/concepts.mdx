## Place of `apx` in the ecosystem

This section describes the place of `apx` in the tech stack related to application development.

### High level architecture and frameworks

Modern Pythonic application development is dominated by two different approaches:

1. **Pythonic backend and frontend** - using Python as the primary language for both backend and frontend.
2. **Backend in Python, frontend in JavaScript** - using Python for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend.

Practice shows that second approach provides wastly more flexibility and allows to use the best tools for the job.

However, the problem is that combining (and supporting) a project with two mixed codebases and building tools is not a trivial task. It take cetain amount of skills and knowledge to correctly configure the repository,
understand the border between frontend and backend, and make sure that project can be developed and deployed in a consistent way.

### How `apx` fits into the ecosystem

<ApxEcosystemDiagram />

`apx` is a tool that helps to solve the problem of combining a project with two mixed codebases and building tools.

It provides a set of commands and tools that help to:

- Configure the repository
- Connect your backend and frontend codebases
- Build and deploy your application

Specifically, `apx` does it in a following way:

1. On the backend side, `apx` uses Python as the primary language and FastAPI as the web framework.
2. `apx` automatically generates a type-safe API client for the frontend in TypeScript.
3. On the frontend side, `apx` uses React as the primary library and Vite as the build tool.
   To simplify the frontend development, `apx` uses `shadcn/ui` as the default set of UI components, and provides a CLI for working with [shadcn registries](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry).

A combination of the above practically resolves the problem of LLM hallucilations, so the only thing the developer needs to to is to describe the desired application behaviour,
and then adjust the frontend by visual means and with the help of the MCP server.
