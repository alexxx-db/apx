# Commiter

Create well-formatted git commits using the `just pm` command with emoji prefixes and conventional commit style.

## When to Use

- When the user asks to commit and push changes
- When the user mentions "just pm" or wants to create a commit
- When the user asks for help with commit messages
- After completing a task and the user wants to save progress

## Emoji Reference

Use ONLY these emojis for commit messages:

| Emoji | Code | Type | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| ✨ | `:sparkles:` | feat | New feature or capability |
| 🐛 | `:bug:` | fix | Bug fix |
| 🔧 | `:wrench:` | chore | Configuration, tooling, or maintenance |
| 📝 | `:memo:` | docs | Documentation changes |
| ♻️ | `:recycle:` | refactor | Code refactoring without behavior change |
| 🎨 | `:art:` | style | Code style, formatting, structure |
| ✅ | `:white_check_mark:` | test | Adding or updating tests |
| 🚀 | `:rocket:` | perf | Performance improvements |
| 🔒 | `:lock:` | security | Security fixes or improvements |
| ⬆️ | `:arrow_up:` | deps | Dependency updates |
| 🗑️ | `:wastebasket:` | remove | Removing code or files |
| 🚧 | `:construction:` | wip | Work in progress |

## Instructions

1. **Gather context** - Run these commands to understand the changes:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --staged
   git diff
   ```

2. **Analyze changes** - Determine the primary type of change:
   - New functionality → feat (✨)
   - Bug fix → fix (🐛)
   - Documentation → docs (📝)
   - Refactoring → refactor (♻️)
   - Configuration/tooling → chore (🔧)
   - Tests → test (✅)

3. **Compose the message** - Format: `<emoji> <type>: <short description>`
   - Keep it under 72 characters total
   - Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
   - Be specific but concise
   - Lowercase after the type prefix

4. **Execute the commit** - Run:
   ```bash
   just pm "<emoji> <type>: <description>"
   ```

## Examples

Good commit messages:
- `✨ feat: add user authentication endpoint`
- `🐛 fix: resolve null pointer in config parser`
- `📝 docs: update API documentation for v2`
- `🔧 chore: add commiter skill for git workflow`
- `♻️ refactor: simplify error handling logic`
- `✅ test: add unit tests for payment module`
- `⬆️ deps: bump fastapi to 0.110.0`

Bad commit messages (avoid these):
- `fix stuff` (too vague)
- `✨ feat: Added the new feature for users` (past tense, too long)
- `🎉 party: celebrate` (wrong emoji, wrong type)

## Multi-Change Commits

If changes span multiple categories, choose the primary one or suggest splitting into multiple commits. Prefer atomic commits that focus on a single concern.

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing, verify:
- [ ] All changes are intentional (review `git diff`)
- [ ] No sensitive data (credentials, secrets) in staged files
- [ ] The commit message accurately describes the changes
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
